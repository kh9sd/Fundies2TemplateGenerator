## This folder is kinda sus

`JavaLexer.py`, `JavaParser.py`, and `JavaParserListener` were generated by
another program.

`__init__`.py is something useless that I have no clue why it's here
except for it broke when I didn't have it before

`java_file_listener.py` is actually human written code, but kinda spaghetti
so beware
